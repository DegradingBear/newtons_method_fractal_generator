# newtons_method_fractal_generator
generates fractals by using newtons methods. Each pixel is assigned a complex number based on is position in the complex plane and then substituting that number iteratively into newtons method converges on some root of the given complex polynomial, each pixel is colored based on which root it converges to, creating a fractal.

Pictured: fractal generated by the complex polynomial P(z) = Z^3 - 1
